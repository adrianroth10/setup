  * (Might be removed) Do not use `git clone`, use `git_clone_or_pull` instead found in `functions.sh`. Example of how it can be used in `scripts/vim.sh`


## TODO 
  * programs to add
    - rubyrails
    - mysql
  * file should only be able to run once if multiple scripts are calling eachother
  * input file should be run automaticly and maybe be put in gitignore
  * add backup script and generic stuff
